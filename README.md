# Kubernetes Repository

## 🚀 Overview
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It enables organizations to efficiently manage clusters of hosts running Linux containers, ensuring scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance.

## 📚 What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a system for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. Initially developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Container Orchestration:** Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Automatically exposes containers using DNS or IP.
- **Configuration Management:** Manage configuration data and secrets securely.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale applications up or down based on resource usage.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts storage systems.

## 🛠️ Kubernetes Components

### 1. **Control Plane**
- **API Server:** Entry point for all API requests.
- **etcd:** A consistent and highly available key-value store.
- **Controller Manager:** Ensures the desired state matches the cluster state.
- **Scheduler:** Places containers on suitable nodes.

### 2. **Nodes**
- **Kubelet:** Ensures containers are running in a Pod.
- **Kube-Proxy:** Maintains network rules.
- **Container Runtime:** Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

### 3. **Pods**
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Can host one or more containers.

## 📦 Kubernetes Objects
- **Pods:** The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object.
- **Services:** Abstracts and exposes Pods.
- **Deployments:** Manages and updates Pods.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets:** Store and manage configuration data.
- **Namespaces:** Virtual clusters within a physical cluster.
